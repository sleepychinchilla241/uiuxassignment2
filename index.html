				Responsive Redesign
			</h1>
		</div>
		<div class = "imageSection">
			<p>
				This project focused on redesigning a page of website that had 
				significant shortcomings when it came to usability, 
				learnability, memorability, and accessibility. <br> 
				I chose to redesign the menu page of Bagel Gourmet, a popular 
				chain of bagel restaurants in Providence, RI. While this page 
				does convey all the necessary information, its layout and visual 
				elements could be greatly improved. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The image below shows the top of the menu page. Interestingly 
				enough, though bagel gourmet specializes in selling bagels, the 
				first section on their menu is "Mexican Specialties" instead of 
				"Bagels". There are multiple other issues outlined below. <br>
			</p>

				<div class="mainListContainer">
					<ul>
						<li> 
							The logo used here is not the same as the logo seen at 
							Bagel Gourmet stores in Providence. Further, it is 
							difficult to read due to poor text contrast. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li> 
							There is a lot of unused white space on the website, 
							which could be better used by changing the layout or 
							increasing the font size. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li> 
							The font size and formatting is mostly uniform 
							throughout the section shown here. The website mostly 
							uses font colour and bold or italicized text to 
							differentiate blocks of text, though this is not 
							standardized throughout either. This makes it difficult 
							to establish a visual heirarchy. The arrangement of text 
							is awkward, with irregular spacing and indentation, with 
							irregular spacing between the menu item and its price, 
							with the price sometimes being on a different line. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li> 
							The navigation panel on the left is also slightly 
							misleading. The "Shopping cart" option may lead a user 
							to think that they can add menu items to their shopping 
							cart by clicking on them on this page, and that this 
							option would simply show them the items they have 
							already added to their cart.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>

				The image below shows the menu page after one scrolls further 
				down. This section, which is further down the menu website, 
				shows the bagel options available at Bagel Gourmet.

				<img class="gridimg" src="./assets/screenshot2.jpg" alt="An annotated screenshot of the website, highlighting some of the usability issues">
				<div class="mainListContainer">
					<ul>
						<li>
							In addition to the issues highlighted above, some other 
							new issues become apparent in this section. The layout 
							suddenly changes to a two-column layout instead of the 
							one-column layout present further up on the website.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							There are also large blocks of text, especially when 
							listing the bagel offerings, which may lead to the user 
							simply skimming the block or ignoring it altogether.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							The prices in this section are also missing some digits. 
							All items that cost less than a dollar do not have the 
							leading zero, which may be confusing to customers at 
							first glance and may lead to their misreading or 
							misinterpreting the price.
						</li>
						<li>
							Another issue with this website, which isn't apparent 
							from these screenshots, is the fact that the entire menu
							is presented on the same page, which can make it 
							difficult for a user to find the section they are 
							interested in.
						</li>
						<li>
							The menu items were also laid out in no particular order
							within their respective sections, which could also be 
							confusing to users who might expect more expensive items
							to occur towards the end of the section. This is also 
							not apparent from the two screenshots provided, but is 
							more noticeable upon scrolling through the entire 
							webpage.

					I also used the WebAim WAVE tool to evaluate the accessibility of 
					the original webpage. Several issues were identified by the tool, 
					which are summarized in the image below. In addition to having a
					missing page title, no language setting, and multiple instances of 
					empty headings and images with no alt text, there were also many
					contrast errors, which I had noticed too. Further, there were
					several instances of null alt text that were mistakenly identified
					as additional features by the tool, but which were actually problematic
					because they were attached to images that did not have captions
					associated with them.

				<p>
					I tried to address the issues raised in the original page's 
					accessibility report by improving the contrast in text, avoiding
					empty headings, etc. I also tested my final webpage using the tool
					to ensure I didn't create any additional accessibility issues in
					my redesign. The redesigned page's accessibility report is summarized
					in the image below.

				Visual Redesign - Lo-fi Prototype
			</h2>
			<p>
				Based on the issues I identified with the original website, I 
				constructed a low-fidelity prototype of a redesigned website.
				I constructed prototypes of the website as it would appear
				on a laptop/desktop, a tablet, and on a phone using Balsamiq.
				<br> <br>
				Include the three lo-fi protypes constructed for the website and
				a few sentences on the main vision for the improved layout. <br>
				Annotate wireframes to point out improvements in design. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The image below shows the low-fidelity wireframe for laptops, 
				with annotations pointing out the problems that the redesigned
				website would address. 
			</p>
			<div class="gridcontainer2">
				<img class="gridimg" src="./assets/annotated_lofi.jpg" alt="An annotated low-fidelity wireframe of the laptop website">
				<div class="mainListContainer">
					<ul>
						<li>
							The most significant change invovled breaking up 
							the menu into sections that could be accessed using a 
							tab bar. This makes it somewhat easier for the user to 
							locate items they are interested in, and also quickly 
							gives the user an idea of the variety of foods offered.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Changing the "Shopping cart" option to "Order online" 
							also ensured the user's conceptual model of the website
							was closer to the actual model. "Order online" is more
							likely to signal to the customer that they cannot order
							items from this webpage and that they should navigate
							to a different page to order online. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Another major change was bringing the "Bagels" to the 
							top of the menu, which made sense since the restaurant 
							specializes in making bagels. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							I also broke up the big block of text listing the bagel
							varieties into smaller itemized lists, with each variety
							on its own line. Users are less likely to skip or skim
							over this section because of the list format.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							I also played with font sizes to demonstrate hierarchy 
							in the menu. I also removed the pictures from the menu 
							on the original website, so the menu items came directly
							under their section header, providing a degree of visual
							continuity within sections. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Lastly, I made sure there were no missing digits, so all 
							prices were displayed in the same format, making it less
							likely that a customer would misread or misinterpret the
							price.

				Visual Redesign - Visual Style Guide

			<div class="gridcontainer2">
				<img class="miniscreenshot" src="./assets/Visual Design Style Guide.png" alt="Visual design style guide">
			<p>
				My website had relatively few interactive elements, so my visual
				style guide was fairly simple. I created a colour scheme based 
				on the colours I typically saw in Bagel Gourmet restaurants, and
				designed interative components and the rest of the website based
				on that.

				Visual Redesign - Hi-fi Prototype.
			</h2>
			<p>
				While the Balsamiq wireframes showed how the website could be
				improved on a lot of fronts, I wanted to explore further 
				improvements in terms of the text formatting and colours used. 
				Based on the visual style guide and the low-fidelity prototype, 
				I constructed three high-fidelity prototypes of the website for
				different screen sizes (laptop, tablet, phone) using Figma. 
				An annotated image of the laptop and tablet prototype is shown 
				below, highlighting improvements made in addition to those made
				by the low-fidelity wireframe. Salient HTML and CSS features are
				also annotated with red ink.

					<ul>
						<li>
							The menu was broken into sections or tabs, with 
							different colours used to distinguish the active tab 
							from all the other tabs. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Text was formatted differently to emphasize hierarchy. 
							<div class="subListContainer">
								<ul>
									<li>
										Section headers are in bold text, with 
										uppercase lettering and a larger font 
										size. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Section subtitles are in lower case, but 
										in a large font size. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Menu items are bold and in a slightly 
										smaller font thant the section header, 
										while additional information about the 
										menu item is in normal font that is of a 
										smaller size than the rest.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Prices of items were places closer to the item, 
							with a line of ellipses to guide the reader's eye to
							the amount corresponding to each item.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							A dark red colour was used for all the text, which
							stood out in contrast to the white background of the
							menu. Line spacing was also standardized to maintain
							visual continuity.
						</li>
						<br>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="mainListContainer">
					<ul>
						<li> 
							The body of the page has four main elements: the header 
							(logo), the navigation bar, the menu, and the footer. The 
							background of the entire page is the deeper burgundy colour
							from the style guide, while the background colours of other 
							elements are independently edited. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							All items on the webpage are centre-aligned, as is all the text
							on the webpage.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li> 
							The menu itself is an element with uniform margins, with flex 
							display. It is broken into sections that contain additional
							sub-elements.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							Each section of the menu contains two or more elements. Each section
							has a header and a container with the list of menu items. Some 
							sections have a section subtitle between the header and the list of
							items. 
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							One element that is unique to the Bagels section is the section listing
							the various bagel varieties offered. This element was constructed using 
							a CSS grid with four columns, each containing one unordered list of 
							four items.
